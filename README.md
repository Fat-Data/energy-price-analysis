 This is a draft price analysis for Euro/MWh at first half of 2017.
 Facetting for each channel is pretty interesting because we can visually compare them.
 However, though, facetting is very communicative we could have a different presentation of data with boxplot graphs. 
 Figures 2 and 3 present boxplot graphs where one can see the dispersion of values among the variables.
 Additionally, Figure 4 is a good example of reverging axis which help us to see the season where prices change rapidly.
